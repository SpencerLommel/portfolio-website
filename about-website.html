            When I first made this portfolio website, I had a small amount of knowledge about html/js/css.
            Besides the websites I made back in middle & high school for fun and the hours spent looking around in the Chrome
            inspector panel I knew nothing. As I constructed this website I would visualize what I wanted it to look like and 
            then when I didn't know how to accomplish that I would look at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Docs</a>
            or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> and pick up on pieces that I could add to my website.
            In my opinion, this is the most amazing thing about programming. You don't need to know everything to create something
            you are happy with; you can research and build as you go. Over the next few months I will continue 
            to improve this website and add new features/technologies.
